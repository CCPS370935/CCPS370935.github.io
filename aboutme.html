  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here?
I’ve been dedicated to building my vested knowledge of STEM Science by enrolling in underclassmen classes which has enabled me to put my foot in the healthcare system. With my experience with helping nonprofit organizations by helping with donations or helping around school issues. Knowing in myself that I have the compassion of helping others and wanting to see others fulfill a healthy and safe life. Which allowed me the compassion to further my professional life journey in taking the necessity of helping take care of others. Pursuing a degree in medicine will allow me to care for others.
How am I working toward these goals?
The methods that I’ve been using to help reach my goal. Is began more mindful of my time management which has allowed me to give time to the important things that will allow me to succeed further. Being a part of Champions has also provided me with helpful knowledge tools for me to follow as I make strides in the right direction toward my goals. Working hard on concepts that are stumbling my path will allow me a clearer path as I continue my journey.
What values do I consider most necessary for my success?
There are so many values I consider to be most necessary for my success. But the top value I would consider to be my reason for success is having a correct mindset on things, wanting something in life does not come by luck for me but the hard work I put in will lead to success in achieving it. Another important value I would consider is having motivation knowing the effort you put into reaching this far in life gives the acknowledgment of having no reason why I can’t become successful.
What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?
I wish in the short-term for me to have read countless more books that will help me increase my knowledge of things in life. To also improve my communication and networking skills, having these skills more mastered will allow me to gain more opportunities by inquiring about others' knowledge on things that can better assist in performing on skills that I have less knowledge of.
What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?
Character traits that I wish others to describe me as; a person who has a strong ambition in class and who’s always completing tasks on time, an honorable person who acts according to what’s been asked of me, and I portray a very honest person who can be fully trusted with anything given to me and will always give out the full truth. An achievement I want to be remembered for is putting together an Earth Week event for the Green Club for my high school where students each day would bring different materials to be recycled, or reused all in an effort to raise awareness of making changes to impacting Earth climate issues, with helping to demonstrate any small deed of kindness of work done for the Earth can make an impact.
